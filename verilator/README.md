Ready to run Verilator setup, scripts provided for Windows OS

Preparation

Some DLL and EXE files are compressed with 7zip, they should be unzipped into their current location if they are needed, mingw is needed to recompile the verilated executables, if mingw is not installed ready made executables can be used (unzip DLL's in the ./dll folder!). Verilator executable is also included. So it is full standalone package to run verilator from HDL sources.


Folders
